# Error EC1000: Enum class must be abstract

##### Description
A type annotated with the `[EnumClass]` attribute must be marked as `abstract` to prevent direct instantiation of the base type.

##### ✅ Automatic fix available
A _"Make abstract"_ code fix is available:

```diff
  [EnumClass]
- public record Shape
+ public abstract record Shape
  {
      // (...)
  }
```

##### ⛔ Not configurable
This rule is required to enforce the basic semantics of enum classes. It can not be disabled.
