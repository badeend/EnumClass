# Warning EC2001: Switch expression on enum class is not exhaustive

##### Description

A `switch`-expression does not definitely handle all the possible input values.

##### âœ… Automatic fix available
An _"Add remaining cases"_ code fix is available:

```diff
  public class Program
  {
      public double CalculateArea(Shape shape)
      {
          return shape switch
          {
              Shape.Circle circle => Math.PI * circle.Radius * circle.Radius,
              Shape.Rectangle rectangle => rectangle.Width * rectangle.Height,
+             Shape.Triangle triangle => ,
          };
      }
  }

  [EnumClass]
  public abstract record Shape
  {
      private Shape() { }
  
      public record Circle(double Radius) : Shape;
      public record Rectangle(double Width, double Height) : Shape;
      public record Triangle(double SideLength) : Shape;
  }
```

##### Alternative solution

If _not_ handling the missing cases was intentional, add a catch-all pattern (such as `_`) as the last arm of the switch expression.

Note that by doing this, you essentially opt-out of exhaustiveness checking for this `switch`-expression. The analyzers won't be able to warn you when a new case is added to the enum in the future.
