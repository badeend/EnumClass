# Error EC1001: Cannot extend enum class outside of its definition

##### Description
All subclasses of an `[EnumClass]` type must be nested directly within their parent type. This restriction ensures that the set of possible subtypes remains fixed and known at compile-time.

If you want, you can still split out the cases into separate files by making the parent class `partial`.

##### Example
**Bad:**

```cs
[EnumClass]
public abstract record Shape
{
    private Shape() {}
}

public record Circle(float Radius) : Shape;
//                                   ^^^^^ ERROR: Cannot extend enum class outside of its definition.
```

**Potential solution:** Move case into enum class:

```cs
[EnumClass]
public abstract record Shape
{
    private Shape() {}

    public record Circle(float Radius) : Shape;
}
```

##### â›” Not configurable
This rule is required to enforce the basic semantics of enum classes. It can not be disabled.
