# Warning EC1031: Enum class does not contain any cases

##### Description

A type has been annotated with `[EnumClass]`, but does not contain any subclasses. This is most likely because the developer forgot to add the cases at all or forgot to make the cases extend the parent class. Unless further action is taken, the enum type can not be instantiated.
