# Error EC1006: Incorrectly placed enum case

Enum cases must be placed as a direct child of their base class.

##### Example
**Bad:**

```cs
[EnumClass]
public abstract record Shape
{
    private Shape() {}

    public record Circle(float Radius) : Shape;

    public class Polygon
    {
        public record Hexagon(float SideLength) : Shape;
        //            ^^^^^^^ ERROR: Incorrectly placed enum case.
    }
}
```

**Potential solution #1:** Introduce nested `[EnumClass]`:

```cs
[EnumClass]
public abstract record Shape
{
    private Shape() { }

    public record Circle(float Radius) : Shape;

    [EnumClass]
    public abstract record Polygon : Shape
    {
        private Polygon() {}

        public record Hexagon(float SideLength) : Polygon;
    }
}
```

**Potential solution #2:** Move case out of subtype:

```cs
[EnumClass]
public abstract record Shape
{
    private Shape() { }

    public record Circle(float Radius) : Shape;
    public record Hexagon(float SideLength) : Shape;
}
```

##### â›” Not configurable
This rule is required to enforce the basic semantics of enum classes. It can not be disabled.
