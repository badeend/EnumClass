# Error EC1005: Externally accessible constructor not allowed on enum class

##### Description
A type annotated with the `[EnumClass]` attribute may only contain `private` constructors. This is to prevent external extension of the base type.

##### ✅ Automatic fix available
A _"Make private"_ code fix is available:

```diff
  [EnumClass]
  public abstract record Shape
  {
-     public Shape(float area)
+     private Shape(float area)
      {
          // (some logic)
      }

      // (...)
  }
```

##### ⛔ Not configurable
This rule is required to enforce the basic semantics of enum classes. It can not be disabled.
