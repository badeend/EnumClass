# Error EC1003: Enum class must declare a private constructor to prevent external extension

##### Description
A type annotated with the `[EnumClass]` attribute must declare (at least) one `private` constructor to prevent the C# compiler from emitting the implicit parameterless constructor (which is `public`).

##### ✅ Automatic fix available
An _"Add private constructor"_ code fix is available:

```diff
  [EnumClass]
  public abstract record Shape
  {
+     private Shape()
+     {
+         // Private constructor to prevent external extension.
+     }

      // (more cases...)
  }
```

##### ⛔ Not configurable
This rule is required to enforce the basic semantics of enum classes. It can not be disabled.
