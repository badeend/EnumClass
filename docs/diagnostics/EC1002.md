# Error EC1002: Enum case must be at least as visible as the containing enum class

##### Description
A nested "case" class of an `[EnumClass]` must be accessible from outside of that base type.

##### ✅ Automatic fix available
A _"Make public"_ code fix is available:

```diff
  [EnumClass]
  public abstract record Shape
  {
-     record Circle(float Radius) : Shape;
+     public record Circle(float Radius) : Shape;
      
      // (more cases...)
  }
```

##### ⛔ Not configurable
This rule is required to enforce the basic semantics of enum classes. It can not be disabled.
