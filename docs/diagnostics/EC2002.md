# Warning EC2002: Switch statement on enum class is not exhaustive

##### Description

A `switch`-statement does not definitely handle all the possible input values.

##### âœ… Automatic fix available
An _"Add remaining cases"_ code fix is available:

```diff
  public class Program
  {
      public void PrintArea(Shape shape)
      {
          switch (shape)
          {
              case Shape.Circle circle:
                  Console.WriteLine(Math.PI * circle.Radius * circle.Radius);
                  break;
              case Shape.Rectangle rectangle:
                  Console.WriteLine(rectangle.Width * rectangle.Height);
                  break;
+             case Shape.Triangle triangle:
+                 TODO;
+                 break;
          }
      }
  }

  [EnumClass]
  public abstract record Shape
  {
      private Shape() { }
  
      public record Circle(double Radius) : Shape;
      public record Rectangle(double Width, double Height) : Shape;
      public record Triangle(double SideLength) : Shape;
  }
```

##### Alternative solution

If _not_ handling the missing cases was intentional, add a `default:` block to the switch statement.

Note that by doing this, you essentially opt-out of exhaustiveness checking for this `switch`-statement. The analyzers won't be able to warn you when a new case is added to the enum in the future.
