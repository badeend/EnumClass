# Warning EC1030: Nested type does not extend the enum class it is part of

##### Description
An `[EnumClass]` annotated type contains a nested type that doesn't inherit from its parent. Unless further action is taken, the nested type will _not_ be considered an enum case.

##### âœ… Automatic fix available
Typically, this warning surfaces because the programmer simply forgot to add the base type. For this scenario, an _"Extend {parent}"_ code fix is available:

```diff
  [EnumClass]
  public abstract record Shape
  {
-     public record Circle(float Radius);
+     public record Circle(float Radius) : Shape;
  }
```

##### ðŸ™ˆ Safe to ignore
Alternatively, you can suppress this warning if it was intentional.

```diff
  using System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis;

  [EnumClass]
  public abstract record Shape
  {
      // (...)

+     [SuppressMessage("Declaration", "EC1030:Nested type does not extend the enum class it is part of", Justification = "<Pending>")]
      public class Enumerator : IEnumerator { ... }
  }
```
